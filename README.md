# Knowledge-Alignment-Module

#Overview
The Knowledge Alignment System addresses discrepancies in information retrieved from popular sources like Google Search and Wikipedia. Often, when users search for information, they find conflicting answers across platforms. This project aims to consolidate information from these sources and predict the most accurate and reliable answer for a given query.

#Key Features
User Query Input

Accepts a natural language query from the user (e.g., "What is the capital of Australia?").
Data Aggregation

#Fetches information from:
#Google Search: Extracts top results using APIs or scraping.
#Wikipedia: Retrieves relevant content using the Wikipedia API.
#Answer Extraction

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from the retrieved sources.
Knowledge Alignment

Implements a machine learning or rule-based model to:
Analyze and rank the reliability of extracted answers.
Predict the best possible response based on alignment between sources.
Final Output

Returns a concise, accurate answer along with optional supporting evidence such as confidence scores and source references.
